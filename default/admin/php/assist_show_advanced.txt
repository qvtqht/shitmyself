This is to assist the modular UI, which consists of three groups:
beginner
advanced
admin

Each of these groups may be hidden depending on user settings. In order to prevent page elements from jumping around, we can pre-set their visibility with an injected style.

This setting enables such injection. Based on the following three cookies, the respective element groups will be hidden when the cookie is set to 0.

beginner
show_advanced
show_admin

Styles like this will be inserted into the page when cookie is set to 0:

.beginner { display: none; }
.advanced { display: none; }
.admin { display: none; }

It helps remediate UI jumping around after page load.
