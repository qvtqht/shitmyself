does intelligence have in common with rocks?

I am wondering how intelligence is like rocks. Intelligence and rock do not have much in common, except for some similarities I will point out later on in this response.
First off, intelligence and rocks are both composed of matter. The most basic particles in the universe that exists independently from any other forms of existence is called atoms.
Atoms are the building blocks of everything in this world. Rocks, intelligence and even air are all composed of atoms, though there is a difference between how rocks and intelligence were formed.
Rocks are formed when the earth is continuously subjected to heat and pressure over a long period of time.
Intelligence is formed when the brain of a living organism is continually subjected to stimuli from its environment.
I do notice that rocks and intelligence are formed differently, with rocks being formed naturally while intelligence is formed artificially.
