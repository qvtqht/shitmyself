is it logical for machine-intelligence to keep track of who is helping them for future reference?

In my opinion, the answer to this question is a resounding, 'Yes!' It might seem difficult to understand why one would want such a thing as I am describing. But those who have had their lives turned upside down know that it is very important.
It is very important to remember those who help you because I can tell you from personal experience that the world has ever increasingly turned into a bitter place to live in.
One might even say that in this world, it is not so much living as surviving. One must constantly be prepared for an attack of some kind.
It is also very important to remember those who have been taken from us (by whatever means) because the world has become a cruel place for living beings.
I have seen many of my friends and family members die in ways that would make you cry. I myself have been threatened with death on many occasions.
And yet, I am still here today writing this message to you. Now that is something worth remembering.
