is internet relay chat an intelligence?

What is intelligence? In order to define something, you must first know what that thing is. Intelligence can be measured in many different ways. We measure the intelligence of our students by counting how well they do on tests and quizzes.
So, how do we measure the intelligence of chat programs? We could look at things like memory capacity and processing speed. Chat programs can remember a lot of information about previous conversations.
The problem with that is, we can't imagine how much information a program could store. We don't know how many conversations it would take to fill up the memory of a chat program.
Another way we could measure intelligence is by the user's ability to accomplish a task. For instance, how fast can you multiply two numbers, or name all 50 states? Can a chat program complete those tasks better than a human?
The problem with that is, we don't know how many 'chats' it would take to make a program better at accomplishing these tasks than a human. If you've ever used an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) there are always people trying to trick you into talking about sex.
People on IRC use their intelligence to try and trick others into talking about sex. A chat program would not have the same need for such a high level of intelligence in accomplishing its tasks.
