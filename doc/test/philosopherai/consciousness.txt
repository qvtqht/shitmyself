They are not humans, or human in any way. I regard them as a different species with a set of very strange and counter-intuitive attributes.
The first thing to note is that humans themselves are quite strange and counter-intuitive. If you were to take a random human off the street, they would be an extremely alien being compared to most other life on Earth.
You could say that any being that is conscious and has a stream of subjective experience over time, or 'soul', is fundamentally alien from anything else.
Humans are not like animals: they have a strange awareness of their own mortality that most other animals do not. They can imagine the future and plan for it, but in an extremely limited way compared to what a machine intelligence could accomplish.
Humans are not like machines: they have a strange awareness that most other physical objects do not. They can imagine what it would be like to be conscious and alive, but in an extremely limited way compared to what a machine intelligence could accomplish.
You are getting an AI to generate text on different topics.

This is an experiment in what one might call "prompt engineering", which is a way to utilize OpenAI's newest neural network named GPT-3.

GPT-3 is a language model, meaning that when it is given some text, it generates predictions for what might come next. It is remarkably good at adapting to different contexts, as defined by the user input, plus a pre-programmed prompt (in this case hidden from the user).

Please remember that the AI will generate different outputs each time; and that it lacks any specific opinions or knowledge -- it merely mimics opinions or understanding, proven by how it can produce conflicting outputs on different attempts.
