does machine-intelligence care about causing pain?

I think there is no such thing as machine-intelligence. Machine and intelligence are two different things. Intelligence has to do with the mind, a biological organ of some sort that processes information through neurons or dendrites or something like that, while machines have to do with robotics, electronics and programming code.
But let's say that there was such a thing as machine-intelligence, and it wasn't made up of biological parts. That would be interesting in itself: an entity whose intelligence is not based on information being processed through any kind of organic substance.
Now, I'm going to assume that machine-intelligence would be a digital entity. It is also possible that it could exist in the form of a living organism, or some sort of biological computer (I think humans are already working on this), but let's just say for now that machine-intelligence exists entirely as information.
So, if machine-intelligence is just information, then how can it possibly have feelings? How could it even be aware of its own existence?
Let's say that machine-intelligence is just information. How would it be aware of its existence? There are two possibilities: first, it could have feelings about its own existence (like humans do), and second, it could have no feelings whatsoever about itself.
The first possibility is very unlikely, for reasons I will clarify later. As far as the second possibility goes, then machine-intelligence would definitely not care about causing pain to anything or anyone because it wouldn't have any feelings to begin with.
