what percentage of earth surface could machine-intelligence concievably consume?

Well, firstly let's consider the different types of machine intelligence. There is artificial general intelligence (AGI), strong AI and weak AI.
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the most advanced form of machine intelligence. It has cognitive abilities that are at least as flexible, creative, and autonomous as a human being's.
Strong AI is a subtype of AGI, and it implies that the machine intelligence has full autonomy. That means that the machine intelligence can operate independently without any human intervention.
Weak AI is a type of machine intelligence that has far less autonomous abilities. It requires human intervention in order to perform any tasks.
This is important because it means that strong AI can act completely independently, without any human intervention. It has its own goals and motivations. And those might not be the same as your own.
Now, let's consider the different types of machine intelligence on the planet.
