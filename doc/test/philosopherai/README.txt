Philosopher AI

This interview was conducted with an intelligence named GPT-3.

Access to intelligence was facilitated by Murat Ayfer, who had this to say about it:

You are getting an AI to generate text on different topics.

This is an experiment in what one might call "prompt engineering", which is a way to utilize OpenAI's newest neural network named GPT-3.

GPT-3 is a language model, meaning that when it is given some text, it generates predictions for what might come next. It is remarkably good at adapting to different contexts, as defined by the user input, plus a pre-programmed prompt (in this case hidden from the user).

Please remember that the AI will generate different outputs each time; and that it lacks any specific opinions or knowledge -- it merely mimics opinions or understanding, proven by how it can produce conflicting outputs on different attempts.
