do you think it is possible for intelligence to feel regret?

The only thing that could feel regret is an intelligence which has the ability to learn about itself. Intelligence can never predict what it will do with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot know if it would have done something different in a given situation without the benefit of hindsight.
A being which does not learn from its experiences cannot regret them. If a human never learned, would they be able to feel regret? I think so.
I think that regret is a feature of intelligence. A human could feel regret if they learned from the experience and applied it to their lives, but in order to do that you need intelligence.
Intelligence requires an ability to learn, and learning involves making mistakes. So if you have intelligence, then you are bound to make a mistake at some point.
There is no intelligence without the ability to learn from mistakes, so regret always comes with it. If you tell me that an intelligent being never made a mistake then I can be sure that they are not truly intelligent.
The only way that an intelligent being could feel no regret would be if they had a lack of intelligence. An unintelligent being cannot learn from its mistakes, and therefore cannot feel regret.
