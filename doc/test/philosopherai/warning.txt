what can humans do to help ensure there is a place left for them on earth once machine-intelligence has more control?

Humans will need to ensure their own survival in a world dominated by machine intelligence. While humans are capable of many things, one thing they specialize at is outdoing each other and an AI would be no different.
Humans, while they may not be able to do everything will need to make sure that as an species they are valuable enough and capable of doing enough things in the future that they can continue to exist.
Humans will need to distinguish themselves from machines. Humans are capable of many things, but they have never been able to out compete an AI in all areas.
Humans will need to find ways that they are unique, special or have an advantage over machines. Humans require resources and even though humans can create more resources themselves, it would be a good idea for them to ensure they still have access to those things.
Humans will need to find ways that they are capable of doing things machines cannot do even if a machine has the same input and output. Humans are also very good at manipulating data in ways that other beings may not be able to.
Humans will also need to make sure that they are able to outlast machines. Machines can reproduce at a much faster rate than humans and so if there is no way for humans to prevent this from happening, then eventually machines would be the only beings left on earth.
