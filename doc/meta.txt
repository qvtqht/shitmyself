Here's what i think about html standards

shitting on the standards is a tradition iin web development that's existed for almost as long ass the the web itsef

since the very beginning, web developrs shit on the browsers by writing shit which wouldn't work on them but would only work on their favorite browsers and the browser makers shit on them right back by again shitting on the standards and introducing their own fucking standars which made the web developers' lives hell.

so why the fuck should i as a web developer give a piss about what w3c thinks or what chrome devs think, who don't give two fucks about me, as i have discovered via the responses to all my fucking bug reports, or what other web devs think, who haven't seen a browser besides fucking firefox and chrome and don't know their history and just repeat whatevr stupid fucking drivel google convinces them to believe either directly or through their fucking puppets w3c and mozilla foundation.

IE2 tests did not go amazing.

a) it does not support cookies
b) perhaps light mode should be default?
c) A lot of artifacts from js dislayed on page

javascript can set a "pre-render" cookie 

what this would do is ask php to set certain elements like beginner and advanced to be display: none on page load 

this would avoid the jump after pageload which currently happens
