My experience with Markdown is that it often causes unexpected content reformatting in ways the author did not intend. Example scenarios include:

* Links to URLs ending with ) symbol
* Text-art which includes \ symbol
* Numbered lists which do not go in order
* Words containing * and _ symbols
* Lines which the user separated, but are joined together

Other things, which are simple in plain-text, are made more difficult with Markdown.

Code formatting, adding titles to links, and line-breaks are all cumbersome, IMO.

Markdown is also whitespace-sensitive, which is a major disadvantage when using copy-paste.

For these reasons, I intend to never make Markdown a default of any kind.

Optional support for Markdown will probably be added in the future, enabled by #markdown tag.

Applying #markdown tag to an item will then render it as Markdown-formatted content.

This is similar to how adding #textart changes the display text to monospace font with spacing preserved.
