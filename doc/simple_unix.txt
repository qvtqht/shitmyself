The strengths that come from UNIX are that it's a worldview where easy things are easy
and hard things are possible, and Perl has taken to that idea in particular.
There's a really old UNIX idea that if something could be represented as
a simple flat text file it ought to be, because then you can edit with regular tools
rather than going into a database or something [similarly cumbersome and proprietary].
