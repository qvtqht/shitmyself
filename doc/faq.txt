Why bother with supporting older browsers?

One reason is that I want to create something lasting.
By writing pages which could have been working for 25 years,
I do not necessarily guarantee that today's code will last another 25,
but I think it will make it more likely.

Another reason is idealistic, in that I believe in the "write strict, parse loose" ideal of the WWW.
I believe in interoperability, into bending over backwards for compatibility.

A third reason is that it's just plain fun!
I didn't set out to support every single browser in existence; My goals were more humble:
I wanted accessibility for vision impaired, no-JS, slow connections,
older devices which cannot be upgraded, average library, school, or homeless shelter computer.
I also wanted it to be Tor-friendly, which has similar limitations.


Do you think many people still use browsers like Mosaic, Netscape, Internet Explorer?

I think that yes, they are occasionally used by people.

Unlike more recent unsupported browsers, which are used primarily by people with an older device,
these old browsers are used primarily by retro-computing hobbyists and the nostalgia-bound.

I think their usage is very small today, but it will continue to rise, as people begin to realize the potential of retro-computing.
I also think it is an issue of there being nothing out there to browse with them, but once there is a place to go, people will use them more.

Each browser has its own feel, and I find many of them pleasant to use, much more than many of today's browsers.



Support Lynx browser? Support Links, w3m, or other text-mode browsers?

Yes, Lynx is supported.
