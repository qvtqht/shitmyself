The permissions system is designed to be simple.
================================================

Note: at this time, this is still in process of being implemented.


There is the top admin user, Admin.

This user has the "admin" tag.

Anyone with "admin" tag can assign any other tag.

For any other tag, you must have the tag assigned to you in order to assign the same tag.

Also, if your tag has a tagset list, you can assign any of those tags as well.

So, for example, here is how it would work with a new admin user performing a non-hostile takeover on a board.

First, the admin.key file would be changed to the new admin's public key.

Then the new admin would vouch the old admin by assigning #admin to them, in order to preserve all their previous actions.

The permissions might then look like this:


NewAdmin
========
#admin ==> OldAdmin


OldAdmin
========
#moderator ==> John, Mary, Suzy, George, Jon

tagset/moderator
================
#remove
#approve


So, anyone who has #moderator tag can also assign #remove and #approve tags.

These would probably be specially-bound tags which perform actions.

For example, the #approve tag may allow a post to appear on the front/top page.

While the #remove tag may cause a post to disappear from the board.

OldAdmin assigned the #moderator tag to five people.

NewAdmin allowed all of OldAdmin's actions to persist by assigning #admin to them as well.

What if NewAdmin wanted to remove the #moderator tag from George and Jon, but not John, Mary or Suzy?

At this time, this depends on whether the tags were assigned together in one item.

If they were assigned separately, you can remove that item.

If they were assigned together, you have to remove the assignment and then re-add the people you want to remain moderators.

In the future, there may be a way to negate existing tags, in case you want to preserve the previous relationships. I have not yet decided if this is necessary.
