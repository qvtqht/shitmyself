Encodings... something to consider
	Especially for older browsers
	#bug Unicode titles get cut off mid-character

Setting to expand css settings to include "test ones"
	e.g. -webkit-foo or -gecko-whatever


Can HTML pages be patched instead of rewritten?
	<span id=abcdef_score>1234</span>
	

if md5(request) in 404.log
	redirect page to md5(request)

	manual (hashes as foo)

A big floating > button seems to be a worthwhile trend


Make forms out of text
	[ ] abc
		becomes <input checkbox name=md5(abc)> abc
	___
		bcomes field
	Nothing else is needed for mvp


pre-cache voted items per author
	make available to clients


Fill-in forms
	Replace _____ with textareas
	____ (desc)


server-vouch
	default/admin/server_vouch/enable
	default/admin/server_vouch/string
	If user posts string
		Item is not posted
		Server vouches user


ask to add vouch for user whose post we're voting on

posts voted on = vouch


private key save methods
	image with qr code
		great for iphone and android
		re-login procedure
			select image from photos
			private key is parsed from image
		save procedure
			qr code and/or image with text
				generated and saved on device



List file type
	List of \n-separated text items
	Doesn't require multiple files
	Can be used for
		404 log
		chat logs
		url lists
	Each item is separate and part of the list

1. Enter password:
Hint: xxxxxxxxyy

2. Submit to adminset.html

3. Generate key, create txt with setadmin token

4. Replace index.html

keygen no worky, just submits form

#todo #meta need more sanity checks and fallbacks

===

when submitting via write.html and redirecting back to write.html, there is no indicator that something has happened.
	nojs

===

need better handling of click-votes

1) should redirect to where it came from
  a) either through a js-cookie
  b) through a server-side trick using location: header

2) message about back button is unclear and now inaccurate since it opens in a new window/tab

===

how to make it easier who wants to fingerprint-sign messages
	without having to remember to check the checkbox every time.



config/enable_blockchain
	builds a "blockchain" of message ids

when tags have many overlap make them related

E-mail and/or fingerprint-verified IDs with more weight

submissions via search field

maybe there should be some kind of quick benchmark to determine the key size?


New users should be engaged somehow, both by the system and existing users


Alternative private key management ideas
* One-time token that validates user-generated key
* Store private keys on server, passworded, for insecure uses

CLEANUP
=======
15 messages have been tagged for removal. There are 30 days left to rescue them.
	Any messages that are untagged and old, basically
		Helpfully-tagged messages get to stay
			Tagged with negative are removed more quickly


Collab dictionary?

One page per thread
===================
Build index based on top-most comment
	How to account for multiple top-most comments due to replies with multiple reply tokens?


#todo writing should be typing + click, just like search

from every page

public search?


Calculate items that are trusted
	Display some kind of checkmark

The tokens for the votes could stand to be more readable
A format like this could work better
This also allows for multiple tags in one token
Should be flexible
	please is optional
	tags are comma-separated, ignore whitespace
	is checksum necessary?

add vote, please
item: 6fa641a277f32c6aae170488ef55b8d7950fefdb
time: 1554491612
tags: surprise, agree,
--

Of course, this also means that tokens are not a neat one line.
Should both be allowed?
Templates?
Internationalization?

Notes from user survey with Anonymous
	Thank you, Anonymous
	> Make it easy to "get into"
	> Votes
		Autofill?
		Scrolling is a pia
		Wheel?
		Pos/negative?
	> Mobile tap areas for the item id
		Too small and not obvious
		Possibly make entire item tappable?
	> Idea: "done" button to exit textarea+keyboard?
		Currently, when textarea is selected, there isn't much to tap on to make it go away
		The txtarea and the keyboard take up most of the screen
		Done button in top right corner of textarea (overlaid) could be solution
	> Group replies together when displaying them on one page

Automatically add expiration date to newly created keys
	One week? month? year? day?

WHERE DO TEXT FILES COME FROM?
==============================
web server -> access.log -> access.pl -> txt/
sftp (uploaded/added straight to filesystem)
clipboard (?)
git
file editor
irc logs

txt -> index.pl -> sqlite -> static website
        \      \
         -> gpg -

    vote -- tag

Because Chrome doesn't respect any form of nobr/no-wrap that I have found, and since it is still very important to keep checkboxes together with their labels, the voting checkboxes now appear as one vertical column in older browsers such as NN3.  We make this offering to the glorious <table>, <tr>, and <td> tags, and we do it gladly. May they live a good life, and may careless browser devs (Lord forgive them) never find a reason to meddle with their implementations. May their parsing be smooth and joyous, may their rows and columns as straight as possible under the  given circumstances, and may their borders always be beveled by default.

Work on installer; Should be easy to install.

Edit button on item pages
	(o) Post new copy item
	(o) Remove current item (requires signature same as current item)
	
Replace non-ASCII characters with ANSI boxes

Make item page sections into detail expandos

JS-less reply form: type in the item ID you're replying to

Allow keygen and signing with OpenPGP.js, but tag it as insecure

Play a joke on Z button users -- keep the original text and use that instead

Clear the unclaimed votes every X hours/days

Only use unclaimed votes in queue (wild west) section

Use confirmed/claimed votes for sorting

More than one key can confirm each vote, and confirmed count rises

By setting the vote tags we target the audience/voters' efforts

Add basic watch for any scripts returning "error"

Make sure "response" pages are not cached (make webserver send a header)

"Style mode" vs "Switch to accessibility mode"

Is it safe to use server-side includes?

Timer: This post will be removed in X day, unless it is given a positive vote

Section: Soon to expire posts

Next item/ Prev item links on every page

"Delete" section, sorted by different criteria

config/auto_delete using
	using all votes
	using only signed votes
	using only admin rights, aka rm txt

Once 9000 posts reached, different options to clone on Add page:
	Best
	Smartest
	etc
	Include only best 5-25% to seed the next one

[x] Encourage editing instead of replying
	- Fill in the reply form with the current post's text
	- Change caption of submit button

Home page contents:
	Instead of latest posts, just a form to submit your public key
	Create symlink for that key, and post encrypted message

Sort tags randomly at first, but allow alphabetizing

How to do preferences???
	Server-side includes and per-user settings via access.log?

Fade pages with more views to make them look more read

How to detect that a particular browser has trouble browsing the site? Dropped connections? No clickthroughs?

Pop up a new node
	Upser uploads tor private key
	Append it to torrc
	Read hostname from /var/lib/tor
	Add to links list
	
NoScript button
	
Split message into lines
	average line length = paragraph
	smaller than average = heading
