custom "visited link" expiration
	keep track client-side
	change color to unvisited when expired
	use cautiously

potentially move <head> to bottom of document, especially js and stylesheet
	this would allow actual content to be above the fold in the html source

cluster line lengths
	the lines which are the shorest 10% become titles automatically

how to recover from between clean and build?


When returning an error on token parse
	could output last 20 lines of debug log
		if it exists



> blockquote ?
>> parent/reference
>>> insert content ?



SYNDICATION
===========
server to client into localstorage
	host list
	items



when items are submitted key=value pairs from the request need to be turned into headers
	or do they? maybe just accept them as tokens?
	what about footer-header? does that need to be turned into = values?

FamilyHub
	family non-emergency canary

maxviewcount
	then burn?
	display on page how many views left
	


Generally speaking, as of late, Template is something which still has $variables, while Widget is something already rendered?

#brainstorm display pgp wordlist for key

javascript can set a "pre-render" cookie

what this would do is ask php to set certain elements like beginner and advanced to be display: none on page load

this would avoid the jump after pageload which currently happens

instead of pre-creating all the tables
	have a static variable in each function which regulates

shim/polyfill idea
	createElement, addChild --> request for server to build form
	



Automatically underline-colorize links using hash of url

server response could stick around at the ?message= url until user clicks thanks

continue segregating languages
 	move addtagattribute js snippets to templates
 	move template under admin/
 		is that ok?

 logged in indicator
 	set by js

 	in template as span with id
 	just like on profile page
 	needs coiokie php

 overthrow_password
 	the password is a hash of a known-to-admin string
 	for x days, the entire password must be matched

Ideas from nullprogram
	Tags page has good layout.
		Large text "Articles tagged 'foo'" at the top
		One-line date + title listing
		Reverse-chron
		RSS button
	Top bar has two columns, bio and links
	Public inbox (actually link to src hut)
	

primary tag list

retroactive registration

collapse/expand images

views with/without images and content

improve handling of list/* as lists (arrays?)

an entire thread from facebook, reddit, or twitter, can be imported
	substitute anonymous for all the usernames

onpageunload reset please wait button back to its previou caption so that if users presses back it's back to normal again
	there can also be a special js to check for this as well
		implementation details hazy

if txtClock then
	assume special accesibility mode for browsers which do not support tab-based navigation for links
		safari (???)
		opera 12 (only if links have tabindex= set)
		netscape (turn important links into input type=submit buttons)

authors users has interacted with previously should be highlighted somehow
	could also be a separate list for them

client-side user notes

http://sitename.com/0123abcd should be a working link
	a) interpret "o" and "O" as zero
	b) redirect to item page and/or rewrite url
	c) make it prominent to encourage sharing


"where to get a good browser" page
	recommend browsers for each platform
		for older platforms, there should be an archive of installers
		for current platform, configuration info
		commands to install: apt-get and/or rpm/yum, etc


there needs to be server-side insecure (with a warning) key management
	as an option for the no-js user
	key is stored on server, and does all the pgp signing
	can be downloaded if user still has the cookie
	can be uploaded as proof and/or to create server-side entry
	what else?


is there a need for a "basic" and "full" mode?
	does all the html need to be pre-generated?
		perhaps only basic would be pre-generated if php is enabled?
	basic mode
		no js
		no images
		no css
		no tables
		no html comments
		all the links
		voting supported
		no cookies
	is basic mode a theme?

file_id.diz
.nfo files


antispam
========
antispam table which contains fingerprints
	associate fingerprint of each datapoint with item
		usergaent_hash
		ip_hash
		js_hash
		all into the same column to help prevent differentiation
when item is tagged as #spam
	perform search for all item's hashes against other items' hashes and tag them as spam as well


<input hidden js=on>
include js state in form submission


#holytext mode
	hash each line
		allow replies to each line
		may need refinemenet such as replying to a range of lines
	how to handle line numeration:
		either uatomatic or first thing in line
			first thing in line can be assigned as repliable id?
#yesno mode
add #yes and #no tags


environment
===========
cache_dir
html_dir
php_dir
config_dir
scripts_dir



The --\n signature system should probably be replaced
	Idea: abcd.txt.footers file
		Contains all the "footers" (as opposed to headers)
			Host:
			Cookie:
			Fingerprint:
			etc
		Problem: Fragmentation of data
		Advantage: Text file hashes remain the same regardless of footers
	Alternative:
		Calculate hashes without footer



TESTS

When displaying integer timestamps, colorize the first x digits which match current time

How to inject templates into JS where JS needs to insert it into page?
    May be better handled with .createElement() instead of using innerHTML
        This still sort of creates the problem of mixing html and js?

post-processing option:
    replace links with submit buttons
        can enhnace keyboard accessibilty in safari and offbyone browser
        other browsers also favor form controls over links for tab navigation

Options for loggig cookie with access.pl

    --> php can write cookie to log/cookie.log along with some kind of identifier which can be connected back?

When a file is archived from an article copy-paste
    Lines containing junk content can be removed by hash

Typing masker:
    Actual text is concealed, and benign text is displayed instead

Server-assisted compatibility mode for NN2/3 with document.write() ?

<noscript style=display:none>may be useful for something

"Federation"
============
this would allow a cookie id to jump from one server to another, insecurely
user clicks button
	server gives user a temporary secret string
		server sends a signed hash of temporary secret string to target server
			user connects to target server and provides tss

server-side preferences:
Willing to moderate = show/hide elements by class (strip out of html)
Show advanced options = same
Highlight advanced options = modify elements by class
Show hints = same1
Highlight hints = same2
Display username in top menu = fill-in
Notify if page has changed = ???

Should no-cache be applied to profile.html?

Client-side JS UI preferences can be carefully pre-rendered by PHP

Java-PGP for Netscape 2.0-3.0?

	Store
		Find common lines
			Maybe restrict to short lines only?

Adjustable hashing scheme?
	Multiple hashing schme?
		Instead of file_hash, multiple columns?

JS themes
	Take from template/theme*
		Generate json array (or plaintext)

JS localstorage feature check
	If no localstorage then
		Set cookie
			Server reads cookie and provides additional fallback
				Can be done with SSI possibly?
				Also PHP option

how to make it easier who wants to fingerprint-sign messages
	without having to remember to check the checkbox every time.



config/enable_blockchain
	builds a "blockchain" of message ids

when tags have many overlap make them related

E-mail and/or fingerprint-verified IDs with more weight

submissions via search field

maybe there should be some kind of quick benchmark to determine the key size?


New users should be engaged somehow, both by the system and existing users


Alternative private key management ideas
* One-time token that validates user-generated key
* Store private keys on server, passworded, for insecure uses

CLEANUP

Because Chrome doesn't respect any form of nobr/no-wrap that I have found, and since it is still very important to keep checkboxes together with their labels, the voting checkboxes now appear as one vertical column in older browsers such as NN3.  We make this offering to the glorious <table>, <tr>, and <td> tags, and we do it gladly. May they live a good life, and may careless browser devs (Lord forgive them) never find a reason to meddle with their implementations. May their parsing be smooth and joyous, may their rows and columns as straight as possible under the  given circumstances, and may their borders always be beveled by default.

Consider https://dkg.fifthhorseman.net/notes/inline-pgp-harmful/

Work on installer; Should be easy to install.

Edit button on item pages
	(o) Post new copy item
	(o) Remove current item (requires signature same as current item)
	
Replace non-ASCII characters with ANSI boxes

Make item page sections into detail expandos

JS-less reply form: type in the item ID you're replying to

Allow keygen and signing with OpenPGP.js, but tag it as insecure

Play a joke on Z button users -- keep the original text and use that instead

Clear the unclaimed votes every X hours/days

Only use unclaimed votes in queue (wild west) section

Use confirmed/claimed votes for sorting

More than one key can confirm each vote, and confirmed count rises

By setting the vote tags we target the audience/voters' efforts

Add basic watch for any scripts returning "error"

Make sure "response" pages are not cached (make webserver send a header)

"Style mode" vs "Switch to accessibility mode"

Is it safe to use server-side includes?

Timer: This post will be removed in X day, unless it is given a positive vote

Section: Soon to expire posts

Next item/ Prev item links on every page

"Delete" section, sorted by different criteria

config/auto_delete using
	using all votes
	using only signed votes
	using only admin rights, aka rm txt

Once 9000 posts reached, different options to clone on Add page:
	Best
	Smartest
	etc
	Include only best 5-25% to seed the next one

[x] Encourage editing instead of replying
	- Fill in the reply form with the current post's text
	- Change caption of submit button

Home page contents:
	Instead of latest posts, just a form to submit your public key
	Create symlink for that key, and post encrypted message

Sort tags randomly at first, but allow alphabetizing

How to do preferences???
	Server-side includes and per-user settings via access.log?

Fade pages with more views to make them look more read

How to detect that a particular browser has trouble browsing the site? Dropped connections? No clickthroughs?

Pop up a new node
	Upser uploads tor private key
	Append it to torrc
	Read hostname from /var/lib/tor
	Add to links list
	
NoScript button
	
Split message into lines
	average line length = paragraph
	smaller than average = heading


Can some JS be included as base64 and decoded after loading?
	This can be used to selectively enable it for newer browsers

For pre-form browsers, can registration be accomplished with
	Links
	Link re-writing (like WebSphere)

	set by js
	set by php
	in template as span with id
	just like on profile page
	needs coiokie php

overthrow_password
	the password is a hash of a known-to-admin string
	for x days, the entire password must be matched
	but as time goes by, only the first 39, then the first 38 etc chars must be matched
		maybe build a ui for non-technical users to take advantage of bruteforcing too?
	then eventually no password is needed
		some kind of basic intent-verification process would be nice
			that way a random crawl bot doesn't end up being admin
			bots should still be able to admin a board
			that's why it says intent-verification, not human-verification

users can gain weight by calculating hashes
	proof of work
	against their own fingerprint
	plus a number
	must generate a hash which includes '8008135'




overthrow_continue
	admin the previous top admin for continuation of vouchness


page definitions
	template
	positons
	variables
	queries
	etc


Remember if we popped up loading progress before
	If we did, we can make it appear right away instead of with a delay

duration between page and next page load can be tracked
	set click id using message id or something like that
	grab it on the beginning of next pageload

Maintain a constant ~80% approval rate, with bottom 20% of items automatically flushed

operator separately toggled, beginner still has operator options

operator shold enable by default if user is admin
=======
#brainstorm #meta

javascript can set a "pre-render" cookie

what this would do is ask php to set certain elements like beginner and advanced to be display: none on page load

this would avoid the jump after pageload which currently happens

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
#brainstorm

Each time page changes, a small timestamp element could be added to the indicator.

#meta does this mean that config foo = off should set it to 0 or false? =\

edge case for now.
=======
maybe urls could be /parent/child ?

for limited cases

#brainstorm #meta
.
post-formatting mode:
.
resilient paragraphs
.
if there is a list format it like this
.
: item one

another new feature is dev_mode, which allows writing directly into the project docs from browser ui by using #meta tag along with #todo, #bug, or #brainstorm.

this item will end up in todo, if i am not mistaken, because it is first in the list. i decided against writing to all three in this situation (for now)

keyboards: onmousedown and onmouseup could set and clear a timeout for key repeat?

#brainstorm #meta maybe we can checksum the default and/or config tree and rebuild relevant parts automatically if changes detected?

can also piggyback on fossil or git

secret cookie + file md5 = proof checksum

#meta #brainstorm
