Known Issues
============
Cookie-based auth and localstorage+OpenPGP-based auth are not perfectly synced up
    In particular if localstorage is used, then JS is disabled and logged out, then JS is re-enabled, there's weirdness.

When Cookie: and/or Host: footer is added to a message, this may cause the message
to be duplicated when competing processes write different files.
    post.php (which adds files immediately when server receives request) supports adding both headers
    access.pl (which adds files by reading them from the web server's access.log) only supports Host:, but not Cookie:
        The solution is to probably hash the file without its signature and use that as an id, or just the primary id

I don't know how to package libs correctly so that they are part of the repo, but do not conflict with the installed system libs.
	I think it has something to do with some kind of binary attachments that come with the .pm files
	and/or version conflicts

config/admin/server_key_id
	The key specified here must have been generated with the same version of GPG as in use.
		Otherwise, GPG2 will revert to default key

Public key upload doesn't update html profile page
	Sometimes
	for unknown reasons
	Workaround: clean-build

Remember to clean-build after updating default/
	Because it is copied to config/ when accessed
	clean-build will clear config/template/ and config/string/
	This can cause accidental deletion of configuration
	#todo rename to html.epoch and default.epoch or something
	Remove the zip files to save space
		How to check if needed? Total space?

Long messages without JS may cause URI too long error
	With JS, the form is automatically switched to POST
	There needs to be a warning and another page
	Maybe the default page should have a one-liner textbox
