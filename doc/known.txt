Known Issues
============
For titles and self-assigned names, they take precedence unpredictably, but usually in order of posting.
	Your best bet is to flag and remove the old value
	This affects the following tokens:
		title:
		my name is

For the "my name is" token
	Must be the first item published by cookied author in order for the avatar to appear
		Workaround: rm cache/avatar*

In Opera 12.x, registration fails
	This is due to OpenPGP.js throwing an error
		Fix 1: polyfill getRandomValues()
		Fix 2: handle exeptions thrown by openpgp with fallback

Browsers which do not support Unicode display gibberish when faced with non-Ascii characters
    This can be remediated in the future by down-converting to one particular encoding based on which non-ascii characters are used
        e.g. if there are Cyrillic Unicode characters present, down-convert into koi8-r or

When rebuilding site, the config settings are re-applied one by one as the items are indexed
    This means, for example, theme values set with setconfig/html/theme will change, and you may see different themes applied on some pages

Content returned via PHP shims has different headers
    there is no etag or time-created
    gzip is not used, so filesize is bigger

Voting on author keys does not work, even though the buttons on the authors list page try.

Lighttpd directory listings cause JS error in NN3

Cookie-based id is not applied to many actions

Cookie-based auth and localstorage+OpenPGP-based auth are not perfectly synced up
    In particular if localstorage is used, then JS is disabled and logged out, then JS is re-enabled, there's weirdness.

When Cookie: and/or Host: footer is added to a message, this may cause the message
to be duplicated when competing processes write different files.
    post.php (which adds files immediately when server receives request) supports adding both headers
    access.pl (which adds files by reading them from the web server's access.log) only supports Host:, but not Cookie:
        The solution is to probably hash the file without its signature and use that as an id, or just the primary id

I don't know how to package libs correctly so that they are part of the repo, but do not conflict with the installed system libs.
	I think it has something to do with some kind of binary attachments that come with the .pm files
	and/or version conflicts

config/admin/server_key_id
	The key specified here must have been generated with the same version of GPG as in use.
		Otherwise, GPG2 will revert to default key

Public key upload doesn't update html profile page
	Sometimes
	for unknown reasons
	Workaround: clean-build

Remember to clean-build after updating default/
	Because it is copied to config/ when accessed
	clean-build will clear config/template/ and config/string/
	This can cause accidental deletion of configuration
	#todo rename to html.epoch and default.epoch or something
	Remove the zip files to save space
		How to check if needed? Total space?

Long messages without JS may cause URI too long error
	With JS, the form is automatically switched to POST
	There needs to be a warning and another page
	Maybe the default page should have a one-liner textbox

Crashes experienced
	Mosaic
	IE4
	Opera 3


just a basic prototype, not optimized to scale, and still a work in progress

all 40-character-long hex-looking strings are assumed to be existing items
	linked in the html-ized posts, even if they do not exist

voter id should (debatable) be generated once per page, but is currently generated once per item.

when an encrypted message has multiple recipients, only the first is used.

server_key_id is tricky, must be 16 chars all caps
