Known Issues
============
Just a basic prototype, not optimized to scale, and still a work in progress

Sometimes new entries stop being picked up from access.log and/or written to the access log by web server
	The solution is to rm or trim the access log and restart the web server
	The cause is still unknown to me, probably file is too big

Timestamp in the page footer (when inserted by php) is, for some reason, not updated on the first ShowTimestamps(), but is on the second
	As a result, the "x units ago" text is not displayed for the first 5-15 seconds after page load

For the "my name is" token
	Must be the first item published by cookied author in order for the avatar to appear
		Workaround: rm cache/avatar*

Browsers which do not support Unicode display gibberish when faced with non-Ascii characters
    This can be remediated in the future by down-converting to one particular encoding based on which non-ascii characters are used
        e.g. if there are Cyrillic Unicode characters present, down-convert into koi8-r or

When rebuilding site, user-submitted config settings are re-applied one by one as the items are indexed
    This means, for example, theme values set with "#config html/theme"
    	will change, and you may see different themes applied on some pages
    Partially remediated by loading items containing "#config" ahead of everything else except pubkeys

Content returned via PHP shims has different headers
    gzip is not used, so filesize is bigger

Voting on author fingerprints does not work, even though the buttons on the authors list page try.
	Removed buttons

Lighttpd directory listings cause JS error in NN3
	Partially remediated by forbidding directory listings, showing 404 page instead

Cookie-based id is not applied to many actions #todo
	Fix to come

Cookie-based auth and localstorage+OpenPGP-based auth are not perfectly synced up
    In particular if LocalStorage is used, then JS is disabled and logged out
    	then JS is re-enabled, there's weirdness.

When Cookie: and/or Host: footer is added to a message, this may cause the message
to be duplicated when competing processes write different files.
    post.php (which adds files immediately when server receives request) supports adding both headers
    access.pl (which adds files by reading them from the web server's access.log) only supports Host:, but not Cookie:
        The solution is to probably hash the file without its signature and use that as an id, or just the primary id
    Update: This is partially fixed with the "-- " footer separator. However, some issues remain.

Sever-signed confirmation mesages is completely broken at this time

Public key upload doesn't update html profile page
	Sometimes
	for unknown reasons
	Workaround: clean-build

Long messages without JS may cause URI too long error
	With JS, the form is automatically switched to POST
	The Write page contains a warning and a link to POST-based form.

All 40-character-long hex-looking strings are assumed to be existing items
	Linked in the html-ized posts, even if they do not exist

config/puzzle/accept
	Must be in "reverse substring precedence"
	That is, aaa before aa (because aa is substring of aaa)

Logging out does not clear client-side settings
	These settings include list of items user has voted on

There's a piece missing from the PGP-to-cookie auth transition
	See #knownCookieAuth
	Server needs to pass encrypted cookie checksum to client
		and client needs to decrypt it and set it into the checksum cookie

trying to set xhr.timeout causes error in chrome
	//#xhr.timeout

Hashtags are stripped out of default title

config/replies
default/html/reply_form_before_reply_list
default/html/reply_form_after_reply_list
	two reply forms on one page may cause issues with js.
	this would happen if all of those are enabled at once.
	the second reply form would probably not have js enhancements, but would still work.
		because of this, before will take precedence over after
		after will not be shown if before is enabled
