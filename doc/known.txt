Known Issues
============

I don't know how to package libs correctly so that they are part of the repo, but do not conflict with the installed system libs.

	I think it has something to do with some kind of binary attachments that come with the .pm files 
	and/or version conflicts

config/admin/server_key_id
	The key specified here must have been generated with the same version of GPG as in use.
		Otherwise, GPG2 will revert to default key
