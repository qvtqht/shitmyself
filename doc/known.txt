Known Issues
============

I don't know how to package libs correctly so that they are part of the repo, but do not conflict with the installed system libs.

	I think it has something to do with some kind of binary attachments that come with the .pm files 
	and/or version conflicts

config/admin/server_key_id
	The key specified here must have been generated with the same version of GPG as in use.
		Otherwise, GPG2 will revert to default key

Public key upload doesn't update html profile page
	Sometimes
	for unknown reasons
	Workaround: clean-build

Remember to clean-build after updating default/
	Because it is copied to config/ when accessed
	clean-build will clear config/template/ and config/string/
	This can cause accidental deletion of configuration
	#todo rename to html.epoch and default.epoch or something
	Remove the zip files to save space
		How to check if needed? Total space?

Long messages without JS may cause URI too long error
	With JS, the form is automatically switched to POST
	There needs to be a warning and another page
	Maybe the default page should have a one-liner textbox
