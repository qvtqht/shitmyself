Why does lazy-loading of images suck? Let me count the ways...
Lazy-loading sucks for anyone whose connection is not stable or always on.

It also sucks for offlining content you want to read later and archiving.

It's also incompatible with many older browsers, not that anyone seems to care about that.

It's also incompatible with nojs browsers, so most of the images on this blog are white space or blurry preloaders.

Even if everything is working perfectly, the user will see distracting movement as they scroll down the page.
