WHY USE THIS?
=============
Below is an outline of reasons you would want to use sHiTMyseLf.
I have made an attempt to start with less technical reasons first.
As you go along, it gets more technical. Technically.

Empowering
==========
User "account", aka private key, remains in user's possession and control.
Identity can be used across multiple servers without "federation".
Registration is not required, and registering does not require email.
Designed to allow the user to know who is operating the site.

Provable
========
Provable reliability of information integrity with digital signatures.
Provable consensus and voting results -- full transparency.
Provable privacy by allowing end user to control physical access to data.

Portable
========
All forum data is stored as text files, improving ability to archive.
Data is housed by service provider without lock-down.

Customizable
============
Custom themes and appearance using simple commands (like Myspace or Tumblr)

Durable/Decentralized
=====================
All data can be downloaded and replicated, in entirety or in segments.
Can be cloned and re-hosted, with portable user accounts usable across all copies.

Accessible
==========
Accessible to all beings, regardless of hardware, software, or configuration.
Tries very hard to accommodate every known and testable client.
Tested with hundreds of different browsers, devices, and configurations.
Full support for text-mode, no-JS, screen-readers, mouse-free, etc.
Registration is optional, unless operator changes default configuration.
Easier to access via telnet than with most websites.

Securable
=========
Can be operated as static HTML for a smaller attack surface.
JavaScript is also an optional module and optional for clients.

Convenient
==========
Optional PHP and SSI modules for more convenient usage.
Optional client-side JS module for easier client signatures.

Friendly, Compatible, Accessible

Tested for accessibility by vision, mobility, and connectivity impaired users.
Tested with Mosaic, Netscape, IE, Opera, iOS, Android, Lynx, w3m, and more.
Supports all web servers which can write standard access.log format.

Art-Friendly
============
Text-art is accommodated with a monospace font and preserving whitespace layout.
Compatible with historic browsers to allow time-period-accurate installations.

Transparent
===========
Everything posted to community is viewable and verifiable.
Voting logs are transparent, auditable, and trustable (Kevin Bacon)
Meta-moderation is possible by voting on votes, and so on.
Best content (and friends) for each user can be found with vote comparison.
Ballot stuffing and other abuse is detectable with data analysis.
Validation chain prevents tampering with item posting timestamps.
Items can be deleted by operator, but trace remains in timestamp log.

Resilient
=========
Avoid spam target by fine-tuning access.
Avoid advertising by avoiding over-growth.
User-centric operation allows easy migration in case of instance changes.
