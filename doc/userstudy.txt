User Study 10/22
================
Top Comment: Needs "more indication on what's what"
Tasks:
1. Create account
>> Quick and straightforward, once I turned off advanced mode, which was enabled from the previous login.
2. Post question "How do I use this?"
>> Success, user chose own text.
3. Find something to read and vote on it
>> User clicked past several votable things, reaching to a profile page
>>From the profile page, they clicked on the >>reply token (rather than the title bar)

He said he would have thought the titlebar clickable if it was a different color
	[Title bars are traditionally not clickable, other than the text]

When tasked with the (described as advanced) migrating the profile to another device, very little progress was visible.
	[I think it's necessary to use email for sending the private key.]

Thank you, user.

Conclusions: The reply and vote ballot should be combined
	Same set of buttons under the reply form and the vote ballot
Add Signature button is confusing
	Should be changed to the same as the reply buttons
	Possibly an "add comments" button?
		But may be unnecessary if there is a reply box at the top
