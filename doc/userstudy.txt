User Study 4/5 1
================
Thank you, user.

Conclusions: The reply and vote ballot should be combined
	Same set of buttons under the reply form and the vote ballot
Add Signature button is confusing
	Should be changed to the same as the reply buttons
	Possibly an "add comments" button?
		But may be unnecessary if there is a reply box at the top
