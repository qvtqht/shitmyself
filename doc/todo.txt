top menu should be refreshed based on settings
	hide some pages if they're not possible
		e.g. profile, settings
	add links to tags which have >x items

index page should trim long items regardless of #toolong

top of item should also link to item, not just bottom

how to colapse an item



on profile page
	put "logged in state" value on page load into page
		then check if value is same as value determined by js
			if different, take some action (change shown state, and/or reload page?)

"singleton" tags like #motd

tables should regrow if they are missing
	currently ./build.pl is required after ./clean

Features would help me
======================
Offline outbox
Offline web app with all content
Recognize URLs
	scrape
	screenshot
	present
Recognize typical date formats


What's Keeping Website From Being Used?
=======================================
Much confusion
Where to find newest posts??
Search
Rebuild times are long due to generating a page for each item
	Good: Site is fast to come back up
	Need: lazy-generate pages with PHP is enabled
		xItem
		xTag
		xAuthor
		Other
	Need: Avoid generating pages for items with a parent
		Perhaps: Remove permalinks from reply items
	Need: "Site is rebuilding right now" message?
User can't create account from Write or Reply page
	Need: Checkbox to create account in the process of posting
Data export is currently only possible individually (zip files are not generated)
	Need: Generate zip files for each thread, probably on the fly with PHP, if possible
	Need: Generate zip files of forum data:
		By thread (with all dependencies like authors, votes, etc.)
		By date (with all deps)
		By author (with all deps)


/my_bookmarks.php
	returns all my votes based on cookie
		as list of txt urls?
		or?
	allows pulling from another site

If Item is being deleted, all its actions should be undone
    Most db entries should already have a source item field


#bug when clicking reply link on listings page and it goes to item's page, reply textbox does not become focused


in netscape 3, light mode sometimes turns off without asking

#mean hashtag
	[x] hide mean people

#BUG #security image filenames are not shell-escaped before update.pl (?) is called
	reproduce: try an image with an ` in the name

Less Important Things Which Need Fixing
=======================================
Changing the current git commit breaks the site
	This is *kind of* by design, because the commit ID is part of the cache path
	That way there is no incompatible cache
	Need: A way to recover
Emoji menu breaks older browsers
	Need: ???
	It's disabled by default, but makes navigation much nicer
When a user creates a new account, they are taken to profile.html, and then 20s later to profile page
	Need: Message that public profile will be created shortly
	Need: Background profile create request
	Need: Server-side profile create trigger
	Bug: Loading indicator, if it shows up, is auto-hidden, even though now we are waiting for profile to be created.


wherever file counts are done with find
	cache it so that not recounting every time

get rid of /author/ pages
	instead set parent to author's pubkey item

allow aliasing of ??

If you are looking for the $_FILES['error'] code explanations, be sure to read:

Handling File Uploads - Error Messages Explained
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php

25 sparticvs at popebp dot com Â¶7 years ago
A note of security: Don't ever trust $_FILES["image"]["type"]. It takes whatever is sent from the browser, so don't trust this for the image type.  I recommend using finfo_open (http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.finfo-open.php) to verify the MIME type of a file. It will parse the MAGIC in the file and return it's type...this can be trusted (you can also use the "file" program on Unix, but I would refrain from ever making a System call with your PHP code...that's just asking for problems).

HASHTAG VOTES SHOULD APPLY TO PARENT ITEMS
If item is a reply
	If contains hashtag
		Hashtag vote applies to parent
Implementation:
    Stupid way
        1. Index and store all hash tags for given file_hash
        2. Integrate into item_view page if it's top-level
    Smarter way
        1. Create a view which does it automatically for parent-level items
    3.

Views
    Outputs: html listing, rss, zip, pdf, epub, docx, rtf, txt

nn2 #bug cannot register again after clicking sign out

Trigger for change in html/theme setting

Make vouching easier and more visible
	Add vouch button which does correct thing to user profiles
	Display user's vouch status when displaying post
	Potentially hide non-vouched posts as a feature

	Author page
	Tags page

Allow vouching by non-admin users
	Establish vouch chain

Add timestamp to session cookie
	To allow time limit for cookie validity
		This will also require rewriting the cookie now and then

Bug: When vouch/ is used, the first time the item is added
	a duplicate entry in vote_weight is added
		This is cleared during next rebuild

Bug: There's a duplicate <a name=maincontent> on home page

Problem
=======
Whole install can be clobbered by setting a value on a directory

Safe mode:
	If any kind of error occurs
		Rename txt dir
			Create new blank txt dir
				Avoid adding anything to it, but maybe one small message on what just happened?
				Provide zip file of previous directory?
					Maybe just on the first try, as this can cause an error as well


Side-quest
==========
Report bug to lighttpd team
	Bug is that directory listings cause JS error in NN3 and other pre-=== browsers
		There's probably no huge need to use that operator there
			Maybe investigate if anything else would cause error?
				Submit patch?

Import data from FB, G+, IG, etc.

Build threads page
	select * from item_flat where parent_count = 0
		find all children recursively

Add setting to ignore plain URL messages if they are an exact match for a file
	This means no unintentional hit counting via hastext tag

If file is submitted via plain URL, make (optionally) a token noting that

Current Top UI priorities
	Titles
		Already stored in database
		Should replace $hash at the top of items
		Short listing style with titles and attributes only (no text)
	Event listing
		Chronological
		Clear dates
		Grouped by month
		All future/current events
	Author listing
		More friendly table-like listing of authors
			Action counts with sort

Does vote still need timestamp?

Connect users
	Using >> replies for user registration posts
	And/or usernames??
		Any user mentioned can vote to remove the post.

user expiration

link pub-key txt and post from profile

#bug for sub-replies, >> token to be stripped is not set correctly

#bug When 0 text files, there is no Profile link

Colorize item hashes
	Possibly make "short" hashes 12 chars (6+6 for fg/bg color0

[propose edit] button

When >> token is removed from reply box /and/ message is client-signed, the >> isn't replaced, and reply doesn't get attached to parent

Re-enable hashtag links

Try to do a clean install from git clone again
	Current problems:
		./clean-build does not run build.sh for some reason
			Solution: run build.sh manually first time
		access.pl does not work without log/access.log
			Run ./lighttpd.pl and hit the server at least once
		gpg_command was set to gpg, but gpg2 is required on fedora28
			Change config/admin/gpg_command to gpg2

Add quick way to transition cache to new version without clean-build
	Or possibly fallback to old cache if new cache is missing

todo events page should have link to add to
	google calendar
	outlook
	apple
	yahoo
	yandex?
	what others?

record referring sites
	generate registry

whenever a new pubkey is posted
	messages that have "begin signed" header
		and are not attached to an existing pubkey
			should be re-checked

claim_admin token
	if older than 30 days and/or approved by admin
		make admin

publish rss for notification apps

user page should show all replies
	local client should log visited time and highlight new replies

when replying with hash tags, add them to parent too

identity page: disable username textbox while generating new id

#bug get rid of long words/urls in manual, as it makes android chrome sad

fix the remaining duplicate tags (?)

queue pages should be updated
	and or not have tags on them

#bug iframe should not have a border on post page

javascripted one-click vote buttons that reflect status on-page

#bug submitting write-small form from author pages

#bug queue page contains template token

From openpgp.js docs:
	The dist/compat/openpgp.min.js bundle also works with Internet Explorer 11 and old versions of Safari.
Ensure that this (and the non-min version) is the version that is in the templates


Add titles to items x
	If title token present, use that
		If not, use first X of title x

Make sure links work when pages are viewed locally
	They currently do not, because they're /-prefixed

<bump> button --> "bump"+sign --> submit

re-add write-small to home page
	add lazy-loading of crypto.js
		page needs to work before crypto.js is loaded,
			then buttons are integrated into the page, ideally without reflow

make it easy to switch admin x
	remember admin actions as admin actions when admin changes
		alternatively, multiple admins

Current Priorities
==================
Instant updates
	Client-side DOM fill-in
Nicer-looking threading
	Two-level thread nesting
	"Reply" buttons on the item page and the child items
Generate one page for each thread
	Crawl the thread tree and build a graph

Check for, download, and install dependencies
	gpg
	mongoose?
	lighttpd
	perl modules

#todo
# if we need to read from the db, like to generate.pl
# and there is no database, we can fall back on whatever
# version is available

Make it possible to restore from private key without creating new ID first.

Bug: Why does update.pl do a bunch of stuff right after a rebuild?
	Items need to be added to the sub-repo whenever rebuilding

Make JS load more tolerable on slower connections
	* minify the js (and test)
	* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20014933/progress-of-loading-external-js-file

** Fix the bug with messages by new users not being processed correctly **
	This happens if the message is indexed before the public key

Adjust avatars: number of asterisks should reflect
	number of votes/replies/responses the author has attracted
		* anon = 1+
		* anon * = 16+
		** anon * = 128+
		** anon ** = 1024+

Generate client hash in JS for added fingerprinting

Review feed.pl
	Fix rss.txt

Add verification that default/ is consistent with repository
	Warn otherwise (settings should be in config/)

Auto-generate server key if one does not exist
	Store its id in config/admin/server_key_id

Ensure that maincontent tags are present at the right place on all pages
	<main id=maincontent><a name=maincontent></a>

If logged in
	Periodically check for public key on current server
		If doesn't exist, resubmit

SERVER MESSAGE SIGNING
======================
Does server.key.txt exist?
	No:
		generate gen-key-script
		Generate key with gpg --unattended
	Yes:
		Sign message with it

FILE TYPE SUPPORT
=================
Files should be eventually uploadable...
	Somehow
		For trusted users

Other filetypes that can be supported
	latex
	pdf
	txt
	doc
	xls
	and so on

Consider changing background color based on time of day?

FEEDBACK FROM L.F.
==================
it might be helpful to have the tags right on the home page, so that it's not landing on a jumble of messages. + 
2) Submit items via URL without any additional prefix x
   * e.g. http://qdb.us/text.goes.here x
   * test if spaces work in GTr +
3) Set up short URLs to accept input (for live version)
4) Make UI smaller
5) Make links for voting so that form submission not required

Consider changing background color based on time of day?

FEEDBACK FROM L.F.
==================
it might be helpful to have the tags right on the home page, so that it's not landing on a jumble of messages.
Other things can be used to categorize these textboxes and give them more meaning to the user, such as titles, dates, etc.
It might be somewhat counter-intuitive to have the pages going from 14-0 on the top, maybe consider adding a "go back" alongside/instead of these.
Underlining 'publicly and right now' may be confused as a hyperlink, maybe can be left un-underlined. but if you want to emphasize this consider bold or italics
Also, as a personal preference I think the ellipse around the numbers can be removed or made into a rectangle
And consider adding a title/informative header to the page in general, to give more context to what this page is.
   It could be something like "hike.qdb.us" on the very top, a very short description underneath it, and then tabs (home, write, tags, manual) go underneath that

Add to specifications:
   items are always 0-9a-f{40} (lowercase)
   authors are always 0-9A-F{16} (uppercase)
   csrf is always 0-9a-f{32}
   until better specifications are arrived at
   consider an odd-numbered hash of some kind for uniqueness? +
      e.g sha1 with one char removed or added or something +

Write
   [x] enable longer text support
      --> js changes form type to post
         --> goes through php receiver
   what are limitations and how to not lose submission??
      maybe issue a backup get just in case?
         only do this if text is long?
            what else?
test mode: remove random characters from scripts when embedding them in page

How to make things easier???
   More flow can be achieved with more one-click actions
   Most common tags should be one-clickable for JS users
      And possibly for non-JS users, just make them links
      Logged in users should vote as themselves by default
         Make sure this is very, very clear, possibly with a second confirmation 
            [ interesting        v ] [ funny ] [ spam ] [ ... ] --> goes to /abcd.html#vote
            | Vote as Anonymous    |
            | Vote without signing |

Somehow handle cleanup of old .html files

Fix Tags page so that correct counts are displayed +

Add roles directory
    Add roles/admin and roles/moderator
        Add support for having multiple public keys in here as text file

Add client-side handling of HTTP 431 messages when submitting something new

Function to add file to index and update affected pages

Untagged page = all untagged posts
 - make it easier to vote on this one

cookie-based prefs
 - stylesheet
 - hide non-essential ui elements

Maybe try Perl PGP modules? +

No pubkey and/or bad sig should result in big red warning on page/listing +

Front-end signature checks/indicators in input boxes +


js fallback for saving via "more options" link on write-small.template


Hide voting, weight-setting, and other messages from home page
   Add an /all page that displays a feed of everything

When private key is pasted into [restore] textarea,
   automatically check it for presence of private key
      restore if it validates

Ensure caches are deleted when a vote occurs

Merge vote and reply forms

Add a message that appears the first time someone is posting something, like on HN

[Admin] has assigned a weight of [100] to [ABC]
abc can assign a weight of up to 100 to anyone else?

Entertaining stats page
   top voter + top tags = top tags by voter
   top voters
   top used tags
      add to profile page
   number of voters
   number of vote records
   busiest days?

Read profile from user submission
   Decide on syntax
   Receive submission
   Replace into /author/abc/profile.html
   Update added_timestamp
      How? It's in added.log

Add "via [sitename]" to pulled and pushed items

Sometimes generated keys have the header/comment field

rebuilding everything twice is a good way of maintaining integrity

forgot to add conversions to user pages

mod_security can interfere with some signed posts #known

curl
    add to tree
        add timestamp

textarea onchange
    begins with header?
        verify with openpgp
            green if valid

Validate signed input on Write page
    textarea onchange
        begins with header?
            verify signature with opengpg
                green if valid

Link target encryption key with parent id key using gpg --list-keys
   This way "Encrypted message for ..." is linked to the correct profile

Feeds list
   OPML
Make post.html redirect to next drop from access.pl, which will contain any newly-added posts as a list.
   If there is only one post, automatically redirect to it
   Otherwise, "is this one of your posts?"
   Create IndexLogLine() in index.pl
   Create IndexParentLine() in index.pl

Make adding new views easier

Rewrite clock value in php

Voting links cause crash in Mosaic 2.0 and 1.0

#bug Reset settings (with js) does not change checkbox values to their defaults

PHP handler for event.html
	Set date pre-set to current

#bug on iOS, the ticking clock causes the "paste" command to be inaccessible
	When a textarea is held down, the Paste command appears briefly, but disappears as soon as the page needs to refresh
		make clock off by default?
		add clock in settings?

Generate version page for each version mentioned in changelog
