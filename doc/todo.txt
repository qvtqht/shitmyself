ensure all js functions
	a) return a value
	b) have a closing comment


automatically adjust timestamp highlight threshold
	based on spread of item timestamps

merge sqlite junk into two layers -- via shell and via dbi

server response message should have adjustable button caption

#accessibility #todo need alternative way to handle http realm for chrome (chrome does not display it in auth dialog)

If user signs out with cookie and later tries to sign in with localstorage,
	Either sign them out
		or

		or
	Welcome back message?

Add sub to fill template with hash of variables

Compatible Mode
	Rename from Accessibility Mode

Being all caps makes html tags stand out more in a sea of text

Instrument panel

test: are there any files under default/ which are not mentioned anywhere in code?

improve clean process
	instead of rm, use mv
		create directory trash
			under trash, create dated directory
			move everything in there
	at some point, clean out trash directory
		for example, at the end of build
		or on every update
		clean out a bit at a time, so as to not stall flow
		e.g. find first 1000 files and delete them



create "imprint" of shortcut keys so they don't keep changing


attributes should be rewritten back into header-footer

#security #taint
In order to quickly add -T (taint mode) compliance, i've added
some VERY basic sanity checks against these unsafe strings.
The checks should be extended, as they're mostly "not whitespace"
which is however better than nothing.

Store current config
	Compare current config to last stored config
		Publish config if changes

#bug handle404 clashes with server response message

need to make more button sticky via same prefs as settings page

debug.log how to trim top?

ARCHITECTURAL PRIORITIES
========================
* decouple initial file pickup into db and full index
* redirect jankiness from profile and post
* pages not expired from cache


#bug reply field gets autofocused due to write js

route.php
	if the html returning indicates it is the pre-generated version
		call HandleNotFound ($path, $pathRel)

write page:
	if not logged in:
		"other options may be available when you register or sign in"


global timer should check if login state has changed and
	immediately burn crrently open page if state changes

upgrade etc process
	user posts signed token
	server validates
		changes /index.html to status message
		performs upgrade
		build.pl

admin imprint key
	email version
		user enters email which hashes
		server sends one-time auth token to email

#burnit token
	note: you can't burn electrons

.js files can fall behind in version
	self-check against etag somehow

more testing with failed db connection
	fallback solutions

whenever txt is removed
	remove cache
	remove html
		can probably just glob using item's hash ;)

sqlite: set wal mode

cron.lock : change from timestamp-based to timestamp + pid based
	if timestamp is too old, change the pid
	if pid doesn't match self, quit
		check on every loop


aliases based on item attributes
	/123 == could be anything
		chain order
		partial title
		etc
		hashtag
		

PROBLEM: sometimes placeholder page is still not replaced

PROBLEM: there is a sqlite query call every time a page is hit, even if it exists

Prefix all php (and js?) templates with:
	die('removeme');
	then remove the line when building from template

de-couple
	indexing of file into intial hash-filename pair
		this can happen fast
	extensive indexing of file
		this can be put off

useful structural tags
	>>item #addparent <hash>
		add parent to item
	>>item #reparent <hash>
		remove all other parents and attach to <hash>
	>>item #adopt
		sets posting as belonging to author
	>>item #replace [hash]
		if no hash, replace with self
		otherwise replace with item with that hash
			this would mean content is replaced on the page
				with a notice




any account tagging v2
	1) create profile
	2) post "verify <profile>" on reddit userpage
	3) >>profile verify https://... (index.pl)
	4) curl reddit profile url, look for confirmation
		use ./once for caching (task?)
	5) add reddit_username attribute to profile

reddit account tagging
	1) "i claim this reddit account http://
	2) >>1 #redditclaim
		look for parent's hash on reddit page
			if present save it in ./once/
			server-signed "#approve"
		else
			message that it failed, and don't try again until this message is removed
			still save it in ./once/
			#denied
	if you want a do-over, you have to remove the once somehow
	reddit url should be normalized to reduce spam options
		remove any extraneous shit
		make it to //www.reddit.com/
		lowercase the whole thing

let user save/export/import cookie secret key

add option to rotate/trim access.log
	on by default for lighttpd/local
	off by default for other

$$ returns current process id
	make lock file based on this

directory listings
	instead of 404 page, there should be index.html in each directory showing its contents

for js/debug, add comment to end of each line like so:
	// filename.js : 123

check the status of ssi includes module
	add ssi include for status bar

What's Keeping Website From Being Used?
=======================================
Much confusion
Where to find newest posts??
Search
	xSearch form
	xGet search query
	Fetch results
	Display results
		via access.log (delayed)
		via php
	Search results template page
Rebuild times are long due to generating a page for each item
	Good: Site is fast to come back up
	Need: lazy-generate pages with PHP is enabled
		xItem
		xTag
		xAuthor
		Other
	Need: Avoid generating pages for items with a parent
		Perhaps: Remove permalinks from reply items
	Need: "Site is rebuilding right now" message?
User can't create account from Write or Reply page
	Need: Checkbox to create account in the process of posting
Data export is currently only possible individually (zip files are not generated)
	Need: Generate zip files for each thread, probably on the fly with PHP, if possible
	Need: Generate zip files of forum data:
		By thread (with all dependencies like authors, votes, etc.)
		By date (with all deps)
		By author (with all deps)

Features would help me
======================
Offline outbox
Offline web app with all content

top menu should be refreshed based on settings
	hide some pages if they're not possible
		e.g. profile, settings
	add links to tags which have >x items

index page should trim long items regardless of #toolong

top of item should also link to item, not just bottom

how to colapse an item



on profile page
	put "logged in state" value on page load into page
		then check if value is same as value determined by js
			if different, take some action (change shown state, and/or reload page?)

"singleton" tags like #motd

tables should regrow if they are missing
	currently ./build.pl is required after ./clean




/my_bookmarks.php
	returns all my votes based on cookie
		as list of txt urls?
		or?
	allows pulling from another site

If Item is being deleted, all its actions should be undone
    Most db entries should already have a source item field


#bug when clicking reply link on listings page and it goes to item's page, reply textbox does not become focused


in netscape 3, light mode sometimes turns off without asking

move/copy update buton to operator dialog
	move/copy backend piece from post.php to route.php

#BUG #security image filenames are not shell-escaped before update.pl (?) is called
	reproduce: try an image with an ` in the name

Less Important Things Which Need Fixing
=======================================
Changing the current git commit breaks the site
	This is *kind of* by design, because the commit ID is part of the cache path
	That way there is no incompatible cache
	Need: A way to recover
Emoji menu breaks older browsers
	Need: ???
	It's disabled by default, but makes navigation much nicer
When a user creates a new account, they are taken to profile.html, and then 20s later to profile page
	Need: Message that public profile will be created shortly
	Need: Background profile create request
	Need: Server-side profile create trigger
	Bug: Loading indicator, if it shows up, is auto-hidden, even though now we are waiting for profile to be created.


wherever file counts are done with find
	cache it so that not recounting every time

If you are looking for the $_FILES['error'] code explanations, be sure to read:

Handling File Uploads - Error Messages Explained
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php

25 sparticvs at popebp dot com ¶7 years ago
A note of security: Don't ever trust $_FILES["image"]["type"]. It takes whatever is sent from the browser, so don't trust this for the image type.  I recommend using finfo_open (http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.finfo-open.php) to verify the MIME type of a file. It will parse the MAGIC in the file and return it's type...this can be trusted (you can also use the "file" program on Unix, but I would refrain from ever making a System call with your PHP code...that's just asking for problems).

HASHTAG VOTES SHOULD APPLY TO PARENT ITEMS
If item is a reply
	If contains hashtag
		Hashtag vote applies to parent
Implementation:
    Stupid way
        1. Index and store all hash tags for given file_hash
        2. Integrate into item_view page if it's top-level
    Smarter way
        1. Create a view which does it automatically for parent-level items
    3.

Views
    Outputs: html listing, rss, zip, pdf, epub, docx, rtf, txt

nn2 #bug cannot register again after clicking sign out

Trigger for change in html/theme setting
    Basically schedule everything to be re-generated

default/menu/default=read,write,settings,...

Smooth the flow of registering and sharing public key
    dumb redirect #done
    smarter - todo

Make vouching easier and more visible
	Add vouch button which does correct thing to user profiles
	Display user's vouch status when displaying post
	Potentially hide non-vouched posts as a feature

	Author page
	Tags page

	<font> cannot contain <table>

#bug On nn3, without a titlebar and table borders, a title-less post looks strange at the top of the Compost page

	put fingerprint into author field
	Add date field


Fix relativize urls on 404 page #bug
	1. go to /ab/cd
	2. click any link on 404 page
	current solution provides a fix which doesn't work if site is hosted in a subdirectory
	the actual solution is ... ???

Unbreak
	Profile page
	Write page
	Voting

Profile refactor
	Cookie-auth should work for non-JS browsers
	Factor out nuJS code into separate template
	Set cookie via server after private key is set locally

Space-wrap long strings in topics list


Setting for large font size
	Default on "mobile"

Allow vouching by non-admin users
	Establish vouch chain

Add timestamp to session cookie
	To allow time limit for cookie validity
		This will also require rewriting the cookie now and then

Bug: There's a duplicate <a name=maincontent> on home page

Problem
=======
Whole install can be clobbered by setting a value on a directory

Safe mode:
	If any kind of error occurs
		Rename txt dir
			Create new blank txt dir
				Avoid adding anything to it, but maybe one small message on what just happened?
				Provide zip file of previous directory?
					Maybe just on the first try, as this can cause an error as well


Side-quest
==========
Report bug to lighttpd team
	Bug is that directory listings cause JS error in NN3 and other pre-=== browsers
		There's probably no huge need to use that operator there
			Maybe investigate if anything else would cause error?
				Submit patch?

#bug crypto.js and openpgp.js are requested multiple times

Content-Length can cause problem
	If full page fails to download, browser may return error
	Typically sent with static html files
	How to disable it?

#bug with PHP enabled, replies create a dupe
	Dupe contains >> token at the bottom (from access log)

Create titles for
	Pubkey
	One-vote items
	anything else Untitled
	Where to do it?
		Probably insert into item_title
		Or on output
			if pubkey and no title then output 'user registration'

Cache voted items locally so that buttons can be disabled on client-side

Item page :
	Reply box title should be "Re: parent's title" (if there is one)
		All the way up to root comment

Loop through all titlebar elements on page

Consider changing background color based on time of day?

FEEDBACK FROM L.F.
==================
it might be helpful to have the tags right on the home page, so that it's not landing on a jumble of messages. + 
2) Submit items via URL without any additional prefix x

Consider changing background color based on time of day?

FEEDBACK FROM L.F.
==================
it might be helpful to have the tags right on the home page, so that it's not landing on a jumble of messages.
Other things can be used to categorize these textboxes and give them more meaning to the user, such as titles, dates, etc.
It might be somewhat counter-intuitive to have the pages going from 14-0 on the top, maybe consider adding a "go back" alongside/instead of these.
xUnderlining 'publicly and right now' may be confused as a hyperlink, maybe can be left un-underlined. but if you want to emphasize this consider bold or italics
xAlso, as a personal preference I think the ellipse around the numbers can be removed or made into a rectangle
And consider adding a title/informative header to the page in general, to give more context to what this page is.
   It could be something like "hike.qdb.us" on the very top, a very short description underneath it, and then tabs (home, write, tags, manual) go underneath that

Add to specifications:
   items are always 0-9a-f{40} (lowercase)
   authors are always 0-9A-F{16} (uppercase)
   csrf is always 0-9a-f{32}
   until better specifications are arrived at
   consider an odd-numbered hash of some kind for uniqueness? +
      e.g sha1 with one char removed or added or something +

Write
   [x] enable longer text support
      --> js changes form type to post
         --> goes through php receiver
   what are limitations and how to not lose submission??
      maybe issue a backup get just in case?
         only do this if text is long?
            what else?
test mode: remove random characters from scripts when embedding them in page

How to make things easier???
   More flow can be achieved with more one-click actions
   Most common tags should be one-clickable for JS users
      And possibly for non-JS users, just make them links
      Logged in users should vote as themselves by default
         Make sure this is very, very clear, possibly with a second confirmation 
            [ interesting        v ] [ funny ] [ spam ] [ ... ] --> goes to /abcd.html#vote
            | Vote as Anonymous    |
            | Vote without signing |
