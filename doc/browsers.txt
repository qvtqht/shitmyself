BROWSER SUPPORT NOTES
=====================

General advice if early browsers like Mosaic, IE2, NN1 etc. are your priority:
	Mosaic and IE2 are fussy about headers
		Disable php and ssi for more basic headers
		Consider setting light mode default
	They also don't like very large pages
		Disable javascript to reduce file size
	They don't understand Unicode or weird characters
		Enable ascii_only mode

In Opera 12.x, registration fails
	This is due to OpenPGP.js throwing an error
		Fix 1: polyfill getRandomValues()
		Fix 2: handle exeptions thrown by openpgp with fallback

Crashes sometimes experienced
	Mosaic
	IE4
	Opera 3

In IE 5.5. item pages return a JavaScript error
	Seems to be related to either whitespace or comments
	Exact cause unknown
	Workarounds
		Press OK on the javascript error message, rest of the site works
		Disable JS on browser
		Use Light Mode to strip JS
