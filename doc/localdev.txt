How I do local dev on this.

I have a Fedora LXDE VM.

Onto it, I have installed the necessary packages:

*

I have also installed IntelliJ IDEA Community, with most of the install options disabled, except for Git and GitHub support.

I let it install the Perl support plugin (many thanks to Alexandr Evstigneev).

To "build" the html site, I run "./clean-build"

To start the http server, I use "./lighttpd.sh". The site is then accessible at http://localhost:3000/

To keep the site updating as I interact with it, I run "./loop.pl", which just keeps running update.pl in a loop.
