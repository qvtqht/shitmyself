How I do local dev on this thing:

===

I develop on Fedora LXDE. I've had success running it as a VM on a Mac for an isolated dev enviro.

Onto it, I have installed the following packages:

perl-Digest-MD5 perl-Digest-SHA perl-HTML-Parser perl-DBD-SQLite perl-URI-Encode perl-Digest-SHA1 sqlite lighttpd gnupg gnupg2 perl-Devel-StackTrace perl-Digest-SHA perl-HTML-Parser perl-DBD-SQLite lighttpd-fastcgi
(also in README)

I have also installed IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, with most of the install options disabled, except for Git and GitHub support.
I let it install the Perl support plugin (many thanks to Alexandr Evstigneev).

I have found it wise to exclude html/ config/ log/ cache/ from my project.
Otherwise I get many unwanted results in global search.

===

After editing templates, I run ./clean.sh, and then ./build.pl

To re-import existing data into the newly-built site, I run "./update.pl --all"

To test the non-realtime update features (update.pl), I run ./loop.pl, which just runs update.pl in a loop.

===

Other than Perl, most of the other code lives under default/template.

This is the place to edit code, not config/ and not html/

Both config/ and html/ are cleaned up by clean.sh.
	This also makes new templates take effect on the next build.

Debugging
=========

I exclude html/ config/ log/ cache/ from my project.
Otherwise I accidentally change a cached file which gets overwritten later.

Perl
====
config/admin/debug
==================
Unlike other settings, the value of the file is not checked, its mere presence enables debug mode.
In debug mode any calls to WriteLog() are output to log/log.log

PHP
===
config/admin/php/debug=1
========================
Will dump all WriteLog() output at the bottom of every page.
Marked as class=advanced, click More to see it.
config/admin/php/debug_server_response=1
========================================
Change redirect behavior, providing a link at the top instead of redirecting

JavaScript
==========
onfig/admin/js/debug=1
======================
Any JS injected into pages will have debug output enabled by InjectJS() function.
Works by uncommenting any statements beginning with "alert('DEBUG:"
	Each statement only spans one line
Each JS template has header and footer comments which name the template file

HTML, CSS
=========
Same as JS, each template has a header and footer comment, which facilitates finding where the code is stored.
