How I do local dev on this thing:

===

I have a Fedora LXDE VM. Onto it, I have installed the following packages:

perl-Digest-MD5 perl-Digest-SHA perl-HTML-Parser perl-DBD-SQLite perl-URI-Encode perl-Digest-SHA1 sqlite lighttpd gnupg gnupg2 perl-Devel-StackTrace perl-Digest-SHA perl-HTML-Parser perl-DBD-SQLite lighttpd-fastcgi
(also in README)

I have also installed IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, with most of the install options disabled, except for Git and GitHub support.
I let it install the Perl support plugin (many thanks to Alexandr Evstigneev).

===

To "build" the html site, I run "./clean-build". This deletes a lot of things in config, beware.

To start the http server, I use "./lighttpd.sh". The site is then accessible at http://localhost:3000/

To keep the site updating as I interact with it, I run "./loop.pl", which just keeps running update.pl in a loop.

Debugging
=========

Perl
There is a config file in config/admin/default.
Unlike other settings, the value of the file is not checked, and its presence enables debug mode.
In debug mode any calls to WriteLog are output to both stdout and log/log.log

PHP
In utils.php, there is a function called WriteLog()
In this function, there is an if statement of the form "if (0) {"
To enable debugging, change the 0 to a 1.
Note: Debug output may interfere with cookies

JavaScript
Some of the JS has statements beginning with "alert('DEBUG:"
I have ensured that each statement only spans one line, so global search and replace can be used to enable/disable
To disable, global search and replace "alert('DEBUG:" with "//alert('DEBUG:"
To enable, do the opposite
This can also be accomplished by setting admin/debug_javascript=1
