I get most of my napkins from the following sources:

Piles of napkins left on tables in cafes and eateries.
	These typically get thrown away.

Piles of napkins thrown into the trash that are still clean.
	These are already thrown away, and were on their way to a landfill and/or incinerator.

Just a loose napkin laying on the ground, visibly clean.
	These will probably be thrown away, else find their way floating around outside.

Here and there, if I don't have one and I really need one,
	I will take a napkin or two from a dispenser of new napkins.
	I avoid doing this, as it constitutes new materials.

New materials are crafted out of our environment, and our relatives'
	Every napkin is someone's home, someone's life, in a FIFO queue.
	Every napkin I remove from the dispenser is replaced
		From the box of napkins supplied to the store.
			When that box is over, another must take its place.
				And for every box of napkins that is sent from the factory to the store,
					the napkins factory must produce another box of napkins.
						And for every box of napkins that the factory must produce,
							someone must tear away another tiny little piece of our home
								and turn it into pulp for the napkins factory to make napkins out of.
