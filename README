hike
====
a prototype distributed message board

files
=====
access.pl
reads the access log from the web server and parses actions submitted by clients.
supported formats are apache and lighttpd.

index.pl
takes the files in txt/, log/, and config/ and generates a sqlite database

generate.pl
takes the database generated by index.pl and generates html files in html/

lighttpd.pl
starts an instance of lighttpd using lighttpd.conf, which runs on port 3000

validate.pl
currently doesn't do anything

installation
============
1. http/ should point to the html root. you can just symlink it.
2. log/access.log should point to the access log. ditto on the symlink.
3. access.pl, index.pl, and generate.pl should be in the crontab, in that order

requirements
============
* Perl 5.010+
* zip
* gpg
* git
* URI::Encode
* URI::Escape
* HTML::Parser
* Digest::MD5

On Debian-derived, apt-get install uri-encode-perl libany-uri-escape-perl libhtml-parser-perl

known issues
============
this is just a basic prototype, and is not optimized to scale.
the index db is regenerated every time, which can definitely be optimized.
txt.zip and hike.zip can probably be merged into one zip once adding txt/ to the git repo is fleshed out.
the voter id should be generated once per page, but is currently generated once per item.
