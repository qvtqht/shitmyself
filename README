a prototype distributed message board

files
=====
access.pl
reads the access log from the web server and parses actions submitted by clients.
supported formats are apache and lighttpd.

index.pl
takes the files in txt/, log/, and config/ and generates a sqlite database

generate.pl
takes the database generated by index.pl and generates html files in html/

lighttpd.pl
starts an instance of lighttpd using lighttpd.conf, which runs on port 3000

validate.pl
currently doesn't do anything

installation
============

for local testing
=================
1. install lighttpd
2. use included lighttpd.conf or run ./lighttpd.pl

for apache and lighttpd
=======================
1. symlink log/access.log to wherever your access log lives
2. symlink html root to html/
3. symlink html/txt to txt/ *
4. add ./cron.sh to your crontab, set to run as often as you like

* this part is tricky if html/ is itself a symlink

requirements
============
* Perl 5.010+
* zip
* gpg
* git
* URI::Encode
* URI::Escape
* HTML::Parser
* Digest::MD5

On Debian-derived, apt-get install uri-encode-perl libany-uri-escape-perl libhtml-parser-perl

known issues
============
this is just a basic prototype, and is not optimized to scale.
the index db is regenerated every time, which can definitely be optimized.
the voter id should be generated once per page, but is currently generated once per item.
the html/txt/ symlink has to be created manually for now.
on firefox esr with noscript enabled the iframe doesn't appear, so vote links open in new window/tab
