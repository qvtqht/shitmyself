a prototype distributed message board

files
=====
access.pl
reads the access log from the web server and parses actions submitted by clients.
supported formats are apache and lighttpd.

index.pl
takes the files in html/txt/, log/, and config/ and generates a sqlite database

generate.pl
takes the database generated by index.pl and generates html files in html/

lighttpd.pl
starts an instance of lighttpd using lighttpd.conf, which runs on port 3000

validate.pl
(in the future will) compare the results of index.pl+generate.pl vs gitflow.pl

gitflow.pl
(in the future will) do what index.pl+generate.pl do, but without full rebuild

installation on GNU platforms
=============================

for local testing
=================
1. install lighttpd
2. use included lighttpd.conf or run ./lighttpd.pl

for deployment using apache or lighttpd
=======================================
1. symlink log/access.log to wherever your access log lives
2. symlink html root to html/
3. add ./cron.sh to your crontab, set to run as often as you like

============
* Perl 5.010+
* zip
* gpg

known issues
============
this is just a basic prototype, and is not optimized to scale.

the index db is regenerated every time, which can definitely be optimized.

the voter id should (debatable) be generated once per page, but is currently generated once per item.

* The html/txt/ symlink has to be created manually

* On Firefox ESR with noscript enabled the iframe doesn't appear, so vote links open in new window/tab

when replying anonymously, footer shows up twice if you leave it in the textarea

* When an encrypted message has multiple recipients, only the first is used.

terminology
===========
author = anyone with a private key who has posted at least one item
item = a text file with some text in it
tag = a string which can be applied to items as an indicator of its properties
vote = an application of a tag to an item
