	items are always 0-9a-f{40} (lowercase)
	authors are always 0-9A-F{16} (uppercase)

Move SQLite db into cache dir

Write
	[x] enable longer text support
		--> js changes form type to post
			--> goes through php receiver
	what are limitations and how to not lose submission??
		maybe issue a backup get just in case?
			only do this if text is long?
				what else?

How to make things easier???
	More flow can be achieved with more one-click actions
	Most common tags should be one-clickable for JS users
		And possibly for non-JS users, just make them links
		Logged in users should vote as themselves by default
			Make sure this is very, very clear, possibly with a second confirmation 
				[ interesting        v ] [ funny ] [ spam ] [ ... ] --> goes to /abcd.html#vote
				| Vote as Anonymous    |
				| Vote without signing |

        All just client-side js, since we can't control what people do with their own gpg

Function to add file to index and update affected pages

Home page = all tagged posts

Untagged page = all untagged posts
 - make it easier to vote on this one

cookie-based prefs
 - stylesheet
 - hide non-essential ui elements

$fileHash <span class=nonessential>posted by</span> $avatar <span class=nonessential>at</span> 1500000000

Maybe try Perl PGP modules?

No pubkey and/or bad sig should result in big red warning on page/listing

Front-end signature checks/indicators in input boxes

Admin's page should be generated always

site ui elements/forms/areas should be a different color than all the user-entered text content

	With JS, make the checkboxes appear/disappear inside the textbox as addvote/ lines

Add a message that appears the first time someone is posting something, like on HN

[Admin] has assigned a weight of [100] to [ABC]
abc can assign a weight of up to 100 to anyone else?

When listing replies, we can strip the >parenthash part from replies
	while leaving it in the detail view for that comment

Add "via [sitename]" to pulled and pushed items

The Meta refresh seems to be responsible for the scriptless links not turning color

Blank text files still cause problems

NN3 compatibility still needs some work

rebuilding everything twice is a good way of maintaining integrity

move csrf salt to config

forgot to add conversions to user pages

some pages (author pages?) are still in a different func

mod_security can interfere with some signed posts

it would be nice to cut down the posting time from 1-2 minutes to instant.

"create profile" should go to a prefilled textbox with profile template OR to a page to edit profile

Some of the buttons can probably be made full width
	To make them easier to press on mobile

Sometimes on Android the button push is cancelled by the keyboard retract
	Or something like that
		Load page
		Press Write
		Fill in message
		Press the "Post" button
			Expected: Posted
			Actual: First tab is usually ignored
